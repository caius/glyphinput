# What Is It?

This is an Input Manager for OS X which allows one to quickly insert the glyph representation of a keystroke (e.g. `⇧⌘F`) into any text field. 

I originally wrote this while learning Objective-C/Cocoa, and the project was based on Michael McCracken’s Incremental Search Input Manager (ISIM).
